[41](https://softwareg.com.au/blogs/computer-hardware/event-id-for-high-cpu-utilization) - This Event ID is often known as the "Kernel-Power" event and indicates a sudden system restart or shutdown without a proper shutdown process. In some cases, this event can result in high CPU utilization upon system startup.

- [11](https://superuser.com/questions/141064/system-event-id-11-disk) - In almost all cases, these messages are being posted due to hardware problems with either the controller or, more likely, a device that is attached to the controller in question. The hardware problems can be associated with poor cabling, incorrect termination or transfer rate settings, lazy or slow device responses to relinquish the SCSI bus, a faulty device, or, in very rare cases, a poorly written device driver.

- [1000](https://softwareg.com.au/blogs/computer-hardware/event-id-for-high-cpu-utilization) - This Event ID indicates an application error that could be contributing to high CPU utilization. It often occurs when an application crashes or becomes unresponsive, leading to increased CPU usage.
- [1001, 1002](https://keysswift.com/blogs/computer-hardware/understanding-event-id-for-high-cpu-utilization-a-comprehensive-guide) - Event ID 1001 and Event ID 1002 are commonly associated with high CPU utilization. Event ID 1001 usually indicates that the CPU has been running at or near its maximum capacity, while Event ID 1002 signifies that the CPU has been running above its maximum capacity.
- [2004](https://softwareg.com.au/blogs/computer-hardware/event-id-for-high-cpu-utilization) - This Event ID is related to Windows Resource Exhaustion Detection and Resolution (RADAR). It signals when a process is consuming excessive system resources, which can cause high CPU utilization.
- [2020](https://softwareg.com.au/blogs/computer-hardware/event-id-for-high-cpu-utilization) - This Event ID is associated with the depletion of non-paged memory pool resources. When this pool is exhausted, it can lead to increased CPU usage and system instability.
